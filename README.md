# SQL Developer Summary: Pizza Sales Analysis Project

In the Pizza Sales Analysis project, I utilized a comprehensive array of SQL concepts to derive meaningful insights and demonstrate expertise in database querying and analysis. Here's a structured summary of my skillset as showcased in this project:

**Core Querying Skills:**
SELECT Statement: Extracted relevant columns and data points for targeted analysis.
WHERE Clause: Filtered data based on specific criteria to focus on relevant subsets.
    
**Data Aggregation and Summarization:**
    Aggregate Functions: Leveraged functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, and MAX/MIN to calculate total sales, average revenue, and other key metrics.
    GROUP BY Clause: Organized data into groups for detailed analysis, such as summarizing sales by pizza type or store location.
    
**Data Sorting and Ranking:**
    ORDER BY Clause: Sorted data to highlight trends, such as highest-grossing items or peak sales periods.
    RANK Function: Assigned rankings to pizzas based on sales performance, enabling identification of best-sellers.
    
**Advanced Query Techniques:**
    JOINS: Combined data from multiple tables, such as orders, customers, and product details, to create a unified dataset.
    Subqueries: Executed nested queries to perform intermediate calculations or derive data points used in the main query.
    
**Data Manipulation:**
    String Functions: Manipulated text data for tasks like formatting customer names or extracting specific string elements.
    Aliases: Simplified complex queries by assigning clear, descriptive names to columns and tables.
    
**Optimization and Fine-tuning:**
    FETCH Clause: Limited the number of results for reports, ensuring optimized query execution and clear output.
